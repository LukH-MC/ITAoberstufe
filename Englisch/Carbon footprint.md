The impact of IT on the environment

| **positive effects**                                                       | **negative effects**                                                                          |

| Cloud computing lowers energy consumption by efficiently sharing resources | IT sector is responsible for 2% of total greenhouse gas emissions                             |
| AI algorithms optimise energy usage in various sectors                     | Electronic devices contain toxic materials like mercury and lead                              |
| IoT devices monitor and optimise energy use in ???                         | Water usage for the production of IT devices in regions where there is already water scarcity |

2) **Examples of greenhouse gases**
	- water vapour
	- carbon dioxide
	- methane
	- nitrous oxide
	- ozone

	**Greenhouse gases, climate and temperature**
	- 

	**Lifestyle and global warming**
	- what you eat
	- your means of transport
	- your clothes
	- how you live

	**Consequences of inaction**
	- surface temperature 2°C higher by 2036
	- extreme weather conditions
	- endangered animal and plant life
	- polar ice caps melt

	**Reasons for global warming**
	- strong carbon emissions

	fossil fuels
	global warming
	greenhouse gases
	ice caps
	industerial revolution
	natural balance
	surface temperature

	Before the industerial revolution in 1750 there was a natural balance between man and nature, and the average surface temperature of the earth was 13.5°C. Now, in the 21th century, it is 15°C because of the use of fossil fuels such as coal and oil in industry and transport. This is because since the 18th century, carbon emissions have increased by 45% and the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have risen dramatically. As a consequence, we now have the problem of global warming, which is melting the polar ice caps and changing our climate. Everyone can help find a solution by reducing their carbon footprint, but this will mean a radical change in lifestyle.
